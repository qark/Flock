	    <p>For eight years, Fedora users and developers have gathered at an event named for them, the Fedora Users and Developers conference (FUDCon). But we grew, and it became time for a new approach: Flock. The first Flock conference was held in Charleston, South Carolina in 2013. This opportunity for Fedora contributors to come together, discuss new ideas, work to make those ideas a reality, and continue to promote the core values of the Fedora community will alternate each year between North America and Europe. Thus the 2014 Flock will be held in Prague, Czech Republic.</p>
        <p>Fedora and the people who participate in the project encompass so much more than just an interest in Linux. Flock is where you meet with other members of the Fedora community who share whatever your interest is, whether that&#8217;s the kernel or the cloud, hardware or UX design. We also want to embrace and invite the growing open hardware community so that we can learn from one another and create better things together.</p>
        <p>This year&#8217;s Flock will be held August 6-9, 2014. If you weren&#8217;t able to join us in 2013, you may still be thinking of the FUDCon barcamp model. Flock, however, operates more like a traditional conference. Just like Fedora, Flock will be thinking big. This conference will have four full days of talks, workshops, hackfests and sprints, We have scheduled sessions covering these and other topics:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Cloud</li>
        <li>Community</li>
        <li>Design</li>
        <li>Desktop</li>
        <li>Embedded</li>
        <li>Fonts</li>
        <li>Gaming</li>
        <li>Infrastructure</li>
        <li>Marketing</li>
        <li>Open hardware</li>
        <li>Quality &amp; Testing</li>
        <li>Security</li>
        <li>Special Interest Groups.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We hope you&#8217;ll join us in Prague. Subscribe to the mailing list to receive updates.</p>
