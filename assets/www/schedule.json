Likewise, more and more people want to work remotely. I get asked quite  often what it is like to work remotely, how I manage to respect  deadlines and actually do some work. Many people think that working  remotely is hard and that just a small set of folks can actually do it.  This is not true!  Working remotely is not just about getting things done. It's more about  getting yourself to the point where you're able to get things done.  Going remote forces people to deal with things like having a good place  to work from, being comfortable, managing their own time, defining  priorities themselves and having time for themselves as well.  Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how hard people try not to  procrastinate, one way or another, procrastination manages to fill a  huge part of the time and you know what, THAT'S FINE!  In this talk, I'll share my experience as a remote developer, the things  that have changed in my life since I stopped commuting every day and  decided to be a prisoner of my own house.

However, it is not FOSS which for core FOSS developers is always  a hurting point.  In two weeks, I developed a light-weight, python and git based forge  allowing anyone to create their project. The forge includes a small,  git-based, documentation browser as well as a light-weight issue  tracker. The project can be forged and pull-requests created and merged.
